            <p>A PC is a computer that runs the operating system (OS) Windows or a form of the operating system Linux. As I'm sure you all know, a computer is good for many things, and many companies make and sell prebuilt PCs. One detail many people get wrong about a PC is that he monitor and computer are different things, at leas in a desktop computer. A desktop computer is housed in that rectangular case you see near the actual monitor. Without it, the monitor wouldn't be able to run any programs.</p>
            <p>So if you can get a PC already built, what's the point in trying to build one? Well, you can control the specific parts, and price of a PC you build. If you want specific specs, building a PC is the best option. Many people also enjoy the experience of building a PC and making it look and perform exactly to your tastes. Many prebuilt PCs, especially laptops also don't have very powerful hardware thats necessary for programs like more demanding games, graphics rendering, and machine learning.</p>
            <p>If you are considering to build a PC, or even buy a prebuilt one, just remember that they aren't cheap. You can't be broke to buy a PC or buy the parts to build one. Especially thoe with higher end hardware, PCs can cost up to more than $1000! However, that's the extreme end. Depending on your needs the parts and specifications you choose for your PC will most likely cost less than the higher end products. You can builbd a more than acceptable PC with a graphics card for $500, much less than $1000. The parts of the PC will be explained in <a href="parts.html" id="normal-link">"What Do I Need to Build a PC?"</a></p>
