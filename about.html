        	<p>My name is Yu-Chen, and I live in New York. I built my own PC in 2016. I chose an Intel Core i5-7500, Crucial Ballistix 8GB RAM, a 550W PSU and GTX 1060. Through some luck and connections, I managed to get a GTX Titan X, which was the most powerful card some years ago. I did a lot of research before building, and used my experience to put together this website. I play the violin, and enjoy playing video games, listening to music and reading. I'm currently learning to code machine learning models with Tensorflow and Nvidia DIGITS.</p>
