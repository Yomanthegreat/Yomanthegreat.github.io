            	<h2>The Parts of a PC and Buying Them</h2>
        	</div>
        	<div class="body-text">
        		<p class="centered">There are many parts that are required to build a PC, and this page will go over them. It will also explain what all the parts do, recommend specific brands and talk about budget.</p>
                <p>I'll start off by talking abou the case of the PC. It houses all of the parts. It should be mentioned that there is a standard system of case measurements, based off your motherboard.</p> 
                <p>The motherboard serves as a base connection area for all of the rest of the parts. Your CPU, RAM, power supply, storage and GPU all connect to it, and power from the supply is distributed. The motherboard comes in a variety of sizes: miniITX, microATX, ATX and extended ATX, from smallest form factor to largest. Generally, you want to aim for a microATX or ATX as they are the most standard and in-between. They are also the most common, so you will find more options. Thus, when buying your case, you must make sure it fits the size of motherboard you have. Another factor of the motherboard that varies is the CPU socket. This is where you insert your proccessor, and it looks like a rectangle in the top center of the motherboard. If you buy an Intel proccessor, the socket will be LGA1151 for 6th and 7th gen chips or LGA 1150 for 4th gen chips. AMD chips use different motherboards and chipsets, so make sure to research thoroughly the motherboard and socket compatible with your CPU. Common motherboard types are B250 and B150, H270 and H170, and Z270 and Z170. These are Intel motherboards, and the ones with the 2 in the hundreths place are newer boards, supporting 7th gen Intel CPUs. Generally, the B-series board are the cheapest but include less extra features. H-series boards are the middle one, with good quality and decent features. Finally, the Z-series boards are the best of the best. Along with being the most high-quailty and fully featured, they are also themost expensive. However, they are the only boards that support <a id="normal-link" href="https://lifehacker.com/a-beginners-introduction-to-overclocking-your-intel-pr-5580998">overclocking</a> out of the box. Make sure not to get mixed up by the motherboard type and CPU socket type!<center><img class="centered" src="Images/motherboardImage.png"></center></p>
                <p>The CPU is probably the smallest yet most important part of the system. It handles all operations of the PC. The two biggest chip makers currently are Intel and AMD. Almost all new proccessors come with a stock cpu cooler that is fine if not overclocking. Intel's chips are trustworthy and dependable, and have great performance. The most common Intel CPUs are the i3, i5, and i7 chips. What you need to know is that the i3s are the cheapest but least powerful, and the i7s are the most powerful and most expensive. Do some research online on sites like <a id="normal-link" href="https://www.newegg.com/">Newegg</a>, <a id="normal-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, and <a id="normal-link" href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a> to find the proccessor that fits your budget. Even cheaper are the Intel Pentium series, which although are much less powerful than the others, have great performance for their price. AMD recently released their Ryzen series proccessors, which are marketed to have better price to performance than Intel's chips. The downside is that less motherboards support the chips, as they are relatively new. AMD is still worth considering though, and again you should do some research to find out of they are for you. <center><img src="Images/cpuImage.png"></center></p>
                <p>Now that you know about the more specific parts, the more compatible poarts come in. First to consider is a power supply. I woulkd recommend not buying this used, as it controls the electricity that comes into the computer, and plugs into an outlet. A fault PSU can surge your system with too much voltage, and damage or even completely destroy parts. Like the motherboard, make sure your case supports your power supply size. Most PSUs come in one size, and almost all cases fit it, so don't worry too much. But, if you are opting for a miniITX system, the smaller form factor case could mean you need a different type of power supply. Most important when choosing a power supply is the voltage. Most PCs can make do with 400-650watt PSUs. However, depending on your graphics card (GPU) and if you wnat to overclokc or not, this might need to change. Make sure to resaerch how much watts your CPU and GPU take, and buy a power supply with a rated wattage of higher than that total.<center><img src="Images/psuImage.png"></center></p>
                <p>The GPU is usually the most expensive, large and important part if you want to game, render graphics or train models in machine learning. Nvidia and AMD are the biggest names in the market. I would highly reccomend Nvidia's graphics cards as they are the most developed and powerful. Note GPUs are not a neccesary part of the system, but most bulders who put together a PC themselves choose to buy a graphics card, which greatly increases the graphics power of your system. The GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti are the cheaper, more budget-friendly cards, with very acceptable performance for their price. On the higher consumer end are the GTX 1080 and 1080 Ti. these are VERY expensive, some costing the same as an entire system, but are probably the best performing, still affordable cards on the market. The sweet spot for Nvidia cards are the GTX 1060, 1070 and 1070 Ti. They have moderate price tags and have awesome performance, usually able to run anything you throw at them. I would reccomend these middle-tiered cards. AMD has many great budget options, which sacrifice more performance for sub $100 prices, and they have higher end cards too. They are also worth checking out, espceially for those on a tight budget.<center><img id="gpuImage" src="Images/gpuImage.png"></center></p>
                <p>Finally comes RAM and storage, both being the easiest to buy. RAM stands for Random Access Memory, and in short, acts like a very fast, temporary storage area for data going to the CPU to be proccessed. Although there are varying RAM speeds, most don't matter for the average builder. Just pick a capacity, 4-8 <a id="normal-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte">GB</a> for normal activities and 16+ GB for more enthusiast options. One thing to pay attention to is if the RAm is for laptops, as you can only put desktop RAM into a desktop motherboard. SO-DIMM is the latop form factor, so don't buy those. Instead but DIMM form factor RAM.<center><img id="ram-image" src="Images/ramImage2.png"></center></p>
                <p>Storage is also easy to buy. There are two most common types of storage: SSDs and HDDs. These store your programs and files, thus it's up to you to decide how much you want. SSDs are more expensive, as they hold less data for a higher price, but are much faster than HDDs. HDDs are cheaper for the amount of data stored, and are great for mass storage. The speed of your storage determines how fast applications and games load, and how fast files are transferred. You can also buy a small SSD to hold some of your more important programs and the OS of the PC, and a HDD to store large files and programs. To give a scale, affordable SSDs usually come in around 50-240 GB sizes, and can range from $50-200+. HDDs can come in 1 TB (that's 1000 GBs!) for just $50, but are much slower and larger than SSDs.</p>
                <p>For a mid-tier PC, I would say to spend about $600-800. I would recommend an Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, a GTX 1060, and 1 TB HDD. A 450 W PSU would be enough. More budget friendly options are the Core i3, GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti, 4 GB RAM and a 400 W PSU.</p>
